# Network-Traffic-Analyzer-and-Firewall
The exponent necessitates network traffic due to IoT, cloud computing, and
mobile applications necessitate advanced network monitoring and security
measures. This paper introduces a network traffic analyzer that monitors, detects,
and mitigates suspicious activities by leveraging Wireshark's `tshark` for packet
analysis. The system identifies anomalies based on traffic patterns and implements
firewall rules using `iptables` to block malicious IP addresses. By integrating a
configurable threshold and a whitelist of trusted IPs, it effectively reduces false
positives and enhances network security. This research demonstrates the tool's
ability to provide real-time insights and proactive defense, significantly improving
network security management
